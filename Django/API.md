# An API acts as a middle man between two different services
# For example, Uber using Google/Google Maps requires an API

# Three types of API's:
# Private, Partner and Public API's

# Using JSON 

# REST API
# REST architecture is as follows: 

# Resources: In REST, everything is considered a resource, which can be any entity that can be identified and manipulated. Resources are typically represented by URLs (Uniform Resource Locators). For example, a user resource might be accessed at https://api.example.com/users.


# HTTP Methods: REST APIs use standard HTTP methods to perform operations on resources:

# CRUD method: Create, Read, Update, Delete

# GET: Retrieve data from the server (e.g., get a list of users).

# POST: Create a new resource on the server (e.g., add a new user).

# PUT: Update an existing resource (e.g., update user information).

# DELETE: Remove a resource from the server (e.g., delete a user).
